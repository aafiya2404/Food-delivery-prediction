# Food-delivery-prediction
In recent years, the food industry has experienced exponential growth, technological advancements, and the convenience it offers. With the proliferation of food delivery platforms and apps, customers now have access to a wide range of restaurant options delivered straight to their doorstep. As this industry continues to expand, optimizing the efficiency of food delivery operations becomes increasingly important for both businesses and consumers.

This project aims to address one of the critical challenges faced by food delivery services: 
Accurately estimating the time it takes for a delivery to reach the customer.
By leveraging machine learning algorithms and predictive modeling techniques, this project seeks to provide reliable estimates of delivery times based on various factors.

Importance:
The Food Delivery Time Prediction project plays a vital role in enhancing customer satisfaction, improving operational efficiency, optimizing resource management, gaining a competitive edge, and driving business growth in the rapidly evolving food delivery industry.

# Technologies used:
1) Python
2) Machine Learning

# Algorithm Used:
Random Forest Classifier: 
Random Forest Classifier belongs to ensemble learning. It is used for classification tasks, where the goal is to predict the class or category of a given input based on its features. However, it can also be adapted for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict a continuous value.
By leveraging the Random Forest algorithm in food delivery time prediction, businesses can make more accurate estimates of delivery times, leading to improved customer satisfaction, efficient resource allocation, and better overall operational performance.
